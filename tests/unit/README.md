# Suggestions for test writers

### Guidelines
 * We trust eachother. So if not critical then we don't write negative tests.
 * Please use `EXPECT_*(expected, actual)` expected, actual ordering.

### About the Google C++ Testing Framework
Please read the [introduction](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Primer.md) article before write tests.
